        A house without furniture is like a barren canvas waiting for realising its own beauty. A home sans classy
        furniture affords no comfort to its owners. Besides, it looks dull and cheerless. What is Furniture? Furniture
        enjoys a long and illustrious presence in our dwellings. It changed its form and style according to the tastes
        of the time. The ornate baroque furniture that once graced the grand abodes of the era is now confined to the
        museums around the world.

    Look, large rugs don’t usually come cheap which is a very understandable reason for not being able to “go big or
    (don’t) go home because your rug is still too small”. But I promise there are affordable options if you dig,
    wait for sales (remember Black Friday is only 2 months away but also HOW?! WHAT IS TIME?!), or take a little
    extra time to save up for the right one. This post goes into all of the things you need to know for choosing
    your perfect rug and has some shopping options (or at least some great places to look if you don’t see something
    that grabs you).

    I am a HUGE offender when it comes to buying wonderful little things I don’t necessarily need. If I turn my desk
    chair around right now, I am staring at three, yes THREE candelabras. I’m getting better but it’s a constant
    struggle.
